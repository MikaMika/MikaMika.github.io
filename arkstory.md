You wake up naked, on a beach, with an implant in your arm, and you know nothing.
Welcome on The Island.

There are Dinosaurs everywhere: on land, in the air and in the water.
Some are iconic legends -- like the Dodo or the T-Rex.
Others are ancestors of modern animals -- like crocodile, dolphin and eagle.
If you tame them, they'll drasticly help you in your survival and evolution.

On the Island, there are 3 floating alien obelisks: Green, Blue and Red.
At their base, is a terminal, that can be interacted with your arm implant.
They require 3 or 4 different artifacts to be activated.
Those can be found deep inside the 10 dangerous caves of the island.
The terminal is a teleporter that brings you to an arena to fight a giant Guardian.
Each Guardian unlocks advanced technology through your implant, called Tek.

With Tek equipments propulsing you to a Golden Age, there is one last place to explore.
Inside the central volcano crater is another terminal in front of a Tek Gate.
Activated with proof of victory over the 3 Guardians, the cave opens.
A horde of the strongest dinosaurs seem to protect the last secrets of the Island.
At the bottom of the spiral, next to flowing lava cascades and lakes, lies a safe place.
Crossing a light barrier, the temperature drops to a freezing cold.
And the only thing in the room is another teleporter.

This is the Hall of History.
Data and archives are displayed left and right.
Monitors show the Guardian's arenas and survivor's stats.
Holograms of planet Earth at different stages, including a desolated one.
It becomes clear why this place is so cold, orbiting above the Island, among the stars.
The Control Room has a panoramic view that enlightens even more, or maybe confuses.
The Island, encapsuled by a construct, is itself orbiting above the dying Earth.
One of many other constructs, that seems to be waiting for instructions.
The Overseer of this place materializes, morphing into challenging forms.
It must ensure that survivors are ready for what's next, with a final battle.
And with it's Core deactivated, the process of Ascension starts, to the next Ark.
